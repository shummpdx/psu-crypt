psu-crypt
A fiestel cipher that will encrypt/decrypt .txt files. DO NOT USE FOR ACTUAL ENCRYPTION

Class: CS585

It takes in a file named 'plaintext.txt' and using 'key.txt' outputs and encrypted version named 'ciphertext.txt'. The encryption process works perfectly, however I never actually wrote the code to send the reversed key through the decryption function and thus decryption doesn't fully decrypt the ciphertext. Since the decryption algorithm is the same as encryption, this cipher should work as intented as per the guidelines provided in the project documentation. 

How to build:
g++ -Wall hummEncrypt.c

hummEncrypt.c - contains source code
