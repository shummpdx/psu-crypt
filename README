I am submitting my implementation of PSU-CRYPT. It takes in a file named 'plaintext.txt' and using 'key.txt' outputs
and encrypted version named 'ciphertext.txt'. None of these files are provided. Unforutantely, encryption does not
work 100% of the time, but the majority of a large block of text can still be recovered. My assumptions is that the
bug has to do with the implementation of reading characters in from a file and converting them.

How to build:
g++ -Wall hummEncrypt.c

hummEncrypt.c - contains source code
